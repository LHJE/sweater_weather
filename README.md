# Sweater Weather[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc6f9llfs0w)

Sweater Weather is a `rails` server which allows users to make API calls to:
- `GET` forecast information for a specific city
- `GET` information about an image related to a specific city and its current weather
- `POST`, or 'register', a new user and assign them an API Key
- `POST`, or 'login', a registered user
- `POST`, or 'search for', details regarding a road trip between two specific cities, including travel time and weather at the location

## Installation

Follow these easy steps, and you'll be running this app in no time[:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pzOBI3PD8E)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LHJE/sweater_weather.git
cd sweater_weather
bundle install
bundle update
bundle exec figaro install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```
You will also need to get API Keys from the following sites:

[Open Weather API](https://api.openweathermap.org)  
[MapQuest API](http://www.mapquestapi.com)  
[Hiking Project API](https://www.hikingproject.com)  
[Upsplash API](https://api.unsplash.com/)  

And add your keys to your `application.yml` file in `config/` like this:
```
WEATHER_API_KEY: "your key"
WEATHER_URL: "https://api.openweathermap.org"

MAP_API_KEY:  "your key"
MAP_URL: "http://www.mapquestapi.com"

TRAILS_API_KEY:  "your key"
TRAILS_URL: "https://www.hikingproject.com/data"

WEATHER_IMAGE_KEY:  "your key"
WEATHER_IMAGE_URL: "https://api.unsplash.com/"
```

You can delete the commented out code in there if you please.  Up to you.


## Usage
Okay[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCXyKmQ4dMc)  Now let's get to using this thing! First things first run in your console/terminal:
```
rails s
```

Now that that's going, open up your [Postman app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).  Each call will have the url `localhost:3000`, like with `localhost:3000/api/v1/forecast?location=denver,co`.  Heck, let's dive in with that one:

### `GET` Responses
#### `GET /api/v1/forecast?location=denver,co`
This is an example of what the forecast response would look like.  I've shortened up the `daily_weather` and `hourly_weather`, which should have 5 and 8 objects in them respectively.
```python
{
    "data": {
        "id": null,
        "type": "forecast",
        "attributes": {
            "id": null,
            "current_weather": {
                "datetime": "2020-11-10 20:50:15 -0700",
                "sunrise": "2020-11-10 06:39:30 -0700",
                "sunset": "2020-11-10 16:48:25 -0700",
                "temperature": 34.27,
                "feels_like": 27.61,
                "humidity": 80,
                "uvi": 2.47,
                "visibility": 6213.71192237334,
                "conditions": "scattered clouds",
                "icon": "01d"
            },
            "daily_weather": [
                {
                    "date": "2020-11-10",
                    "sunrise": "2020-11-10 06:39:30 -0700",
                    "sunset": "2020-11-10 16:48:25 -0700",
                    "max_temp": 47.86,
                    "min_temp": 33.13,
                    "conditions": "clear sky",
                    "icon": "01d"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "hourly_weather": [
                {
                    "hour": "2020-11-10 20:00:00",
                    "temperature": 34.27,
                    "wind_speed": "2.75 mph",
                    "wind_direction": "S 69Â° W",
                    "conditions": "scattered clouds",
                    "icon": "03n"
                },
                 ...
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/backgrounds?location=denver,co`
This is an example of what the image response would look like:
```python
{
    "data": {
        "id": null,
        "type": "image",
        "attributes": {
            "location": "denver,co",
            "image_url": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580408597610-51b1ad419857?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjE4MTMxN30",
            "dimensions": {
                "width": 4240,
                "height": 2832
            },
            "credit": {
                "author": "Payson Wick",
                "author_profile": "https://api.unsplash.com/users/paysonwick"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### POST Responses
The thing with POST responses is you're going to need to give Postman a little more information.  

To do that, in Postman:
- click on where it says `GET`, and change it to `POST`.
- Underneath the bar where you type in the url you're `POST`ing, click the tab 'Body'
- Select `raw` from the dots below the Body tab.
- Click on the far right of this row where it says `Text`, and select       `JSON`

This is where we will be posting our `body`, which is needed to make the call.  Let's continue:

#### `POST /api/v1/users`
Our first `POST` example! The body for this one will look like this:
```
{
  "email": "whatever@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "password_confirmation": "password"
}
```

Here is what the register response would look like:
```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "users",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "email": "whatever@example.com",
      "api_key": "jgn983hy48thw9begh98h4539h4"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `POST /api/v1/sessions`
The body for log in will look like this:
```
{
  "email": "whatever@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

Here is what the login response would look like:
```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "users",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "email": "whatever@example.com",
      "api_key": "jgn983hy48thw9begh98h4539h4"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `POST /api/v1/road_trip`
And finally, the body for road trip will look like this:
```
{
  "origin": "Denver,CO",
  "destination": "Pueblo,CO",
  "api_key": "jgn983hy48thw9begh98h4539h4"
}
```

And here is what the road trip response would look like:
```
{
    "data": {
        "id": null,
        "type": "road_trip",
        "attributes": {
            "start_city": "Denver,CO",
            "end_city": "New York, NY",
            "travel_time": "1 day",
            "weather_at_eta": {
                "temperature": 63.5,
                "conditions": "clear sky"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For fun, here is an example of the road trip response for a destination that doesn't exist:
```
{
    "data": {
        "id": null,
        "type": "road_trip",
        "attributes": {
            "start_city": "Denver,CO",
            "end_city": "4h54543gska",
            "travel_time": "This destination is not reachable",
            "weather_at_eta": "There wasn't enough information to tell you the forecast."
        }
    }
}
```

## Gems Being Utilized
Here are the more relevant gems we've added to the base rails gems to make this app really sing:

```
gem 'faraday'
gem 'webmock'
gem 'vcr'
gem "figaro"
gem 'travis'
```  

We're using `faraday` to allow for API calls.  
We're using `figaro` to abstract the API Keys we're using.  
We're using `webmock` and `vcr`  to stub out API calls for testing.  
We're using `travis` to ensure that new changes to the build merge successfully.  

## Versions

- Ruby 2.5.3
